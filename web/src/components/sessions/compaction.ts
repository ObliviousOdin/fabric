/**
 * Context-compaction handoff parsing (#29824), moved verbatim from
 * SessionsPage with the timeline it feeds (spec §0.1 / S4).
 *
 * Compaction handoff blocks are persisted as ``role="user"`` or
 * ``role="assistant"`` with content starting with one of these prefixes —
 * they're metadata inserted by ``agent/context_compressor.py``, NOT real
 * turns the user typed or the model replied with. Rendering them with
 * the same styling as regular messages confuses operators scrolling the
 * session timeline (#29824 — "WebUI can show context compaction block
 * instead of latest assistant response after compression"), so we
 * detect them here and downgrade them to a muted, clearly-labelled
 * "Context handoff" row.
 *
 * Keep these prefixes (and the END marker below) in sync with
 * ``SUMMARY_PREFIX`` / ``LEGACY_SUMMARY_PREFIX`` and the
 * merge-into-tail marker in ``agent/context_compressor.py``.

// prefix on the first tail message instead of inserting a standalone
// row. We split on this marker so the WebUI still shows the original

// row reads as a single opaque "Context compaction" block and the
// user can't see the reply (#29824).
